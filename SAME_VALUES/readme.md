Write a function named <code>same_values()</code> that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.
<br>
The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.
<br>
For example, the following code should return [0, 2, 3]
<br>
<code>same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5])</code>
